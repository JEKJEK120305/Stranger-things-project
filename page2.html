            <h2 id="things">Stranger Things overview</h2>
            <p id="story">Stranger Things is a sci-fi horror series set in the 1980s in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana. The story begins when Will Byers, a young boy, mysteriously disappears. His friends—Mike, Lucas, and Dustin—search for him and instead find a strange girl with a shaved head who calls herself Eleven. She has telekinetic abilities and has escaped from a secret government lab. As the search continues, the group discovers that Will has been taken into a dark parallel dimension called the Upside Down, a terrifying mirror world filled with monsters. Eleven helps them fight the creatures and understand the connection between the lab and the alternate dimension.<br><br>Throughout the seasons: New monsters emerge from the Upside Down, including the Demogorgon, Demodogs, and the powerful Mind Flayer. Eleven uncovers her origins as a child experiment and grows into a hero who repeatedly saves Hawkins. The town deals with government cover-ups, supernatural threats, and emotional struggles. The group grows older, faces more dangerous creatures, and eventually fights to stop the Upside Down from taking over the real world. Overall, the series mixes friendship, mystery, horror, and nostalgia, showing how a group of kids (and adults) work together to protect their town from a supernatural evil trying to break into their world.</p>

            <p id="plot">The season resumes in the fall of 1987, about a year after the events of Season 4. The town of Hawkins, Indiana is still dealing with the fallout of the earlier “Rifts.” The environment is unstable, and the threat from the other dimension (the Upside Down) looms larger than ever. The core mission: the group is united to find and kill the main antagonist Vecna — but Vecna has vanished, and his plans remain unknown. On top of that, the town is under military quarantine, and there's a government-led manhunt for Eleven — pushing her into hiding again. The season is pitched as a return to the kind of intimate horror-and-mystery vibes from Season 1 — while still maintaining the high stakes and scale built up over later seasons.</p>
